                <p>“For what it’s worth... it’s never too late, or in my case too early, to be whoever you want to be.
                    There’s no time limit. Start whenever you want. You can change or stay the same. There are no rules
                    to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. I hope you
                    see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you’ve never felt before. I hope you meet people
                    who have a different point of view. I hope you live a life you’re proud of, and if you’re not, I
                    hope you have the courage to start over again.” -- F. Scott Fitzgerald</p>

                <p>Hi there! These are one of my favorite quotes that resonate with me on how I'd like to view my
                    pursuit of perpetual learning. Born and grew up in Tokyo most of my childhood, but I've also
                    lived and/or visited 4 different continents around the world so far. My current "home" is Chicago
                    with my dear husband who somehow tolerates my "random" spontaneous nature. We have two little
                    munchkins (ages 1 and 3) who literally suck every bit of physical, mental and emotional energy left
                    of us,
                    but nevertheless fill our hearts in the way we could have never imagined. I love
                    Chicago's summer and fall, but, my heart is always in San Francisco. I love to swim
                    and I hope to always live by the water. I love Art History and fascinated by Statistics. Listening
                    to elderly, or anyone really, talks about one's life story is truly music to
                    my ears! My favorite cuisines are Peruvian and Moroccan. I believe sauteed mushrooms go well on
                    absolutely anything--and of course, Shimeji mushrooms are the BEST. IMHO, more restaurants
                    should serve soups before 11AM. And I'd love to learn how to skateboard, maybe in the near future...
